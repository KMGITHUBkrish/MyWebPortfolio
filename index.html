                <h2><br><br>KRISHANI LIYANAGE</h2>
                <p><br>Once upon a time, a beautiful innocent girl was born in a small family in a beautiful village called Deiyandara .She alone claimed the love of her mother and father , after a while she shared the right of that love with her brother and sister.
                    Although mischievous at heart, she claimed to have a quite character. After her school days she allowed the mischievous character hidden in her to enjoy life.
                    That was when her university life began.Indeed, that was the beginning of the most beautiful time of her life. 
                    Her name is Krishani Liyanage. She is an undergraduate student of faculty of applied sciences at Rajarata university of Sri Lanka in 19/20 batch. She is none other than myself Krishani.</p>
                <br><P>Sometimes I am a poet, sometimes I am a singer, sometimes I am a dancer.Really I enjoy my poetry. I am mortivated by my own words. My best fan is myself. All these roles help me to fulfill my life happily. I think if we want to move forward we have to be honest with ourselves.We have to respect ourselves.</P>

                     I love to have a free lifestyle while continuing my academics

                      it to some extent because of my university friends. I will remember
                       the never-fading beautiful and loving memories that they gifted me 
                       with until I leave my life. Although the time I experienced in my 
                       life still feels very small, those memories will come with me 
                       throughout this lifetime. Many more will be waiting to meet me and 
                       join me.
